Honorable David Laney
Chairman
Amtrak Board of Directors

Dear Mr. Chairman:

This report, submitted pursuant to the Inspector General Act, summarizes the more significant
audits, evaluations, and investigations for the six-month period ending September 30, 2006.

The OIG issued 17 audit reports in the last two quarters, including performing oversight
work for the company’s audited financial statements, evaluating Amtrak’s procurement card
implementation, performing federal grant compliance reviews for the New York Fire and
Life Safety project, and conducting several other procurement reviews.

Our investigators and special agents opened 79 new cases in the past six months and closed
81 cases; 317 investigations remain active as of September 30. We made 13 criminal refer-
rals to the Attorney General, obtaining one indictment, four declinations, three case
resolutions, and five pending prosecutorial review. We continue to investigate several cases
of employee-related fraud and embezzlement, with a number of employee administrative
dismissals and subsequent successful prosecutions.

The OIG Inspections and Evaluations team issued a report on Amtrak’s train fleet manage-
ment processes, making a number of recommendations to improve asset management of
rolling stock. We also issued a report regarding the potential financial impact of poor on-
time performance affecting Amtrak’s long-distance routes, drawing attention to the
difficulty Amtrak has had in managing this important aspect of passenger service.

We have been increasing our outreach and coordination efforts with Amtrak’s security part-
ners. Working with the New York Police Department, we have assisted in promoting the
Northeast Rail Coalition, a group founded by NYPD and Amtrak to increase state and local
law enforcement support of Amtrak’s security needs. We have also conducted further secu-

rity reviews of several major urban stations, and we are making specific recommendations to
management with regard to needed infrastructure counter-measures.

I appreciate your and the Board’s continued support of the OIG’s oversight efforts. We look forward
to working with you in the coming new fiscal year.

Respectfully,




Fred E. Weiderhold, Jr.

FY 2006 YEAR-END FINANCIAL
RESULTS
Amtrak completed the fiscal year with $2.017 billion in total
revenue ($1.565 billion in passenger related revenues), and total
expenses were $2.940 billion. Amtrak’s adjusted losses, before
depreciation, were $1.127 billion, $101.8 million better than
budget, and $65.5 million better than last fiscal year.

SECURITY
In September 2006, the OIG sponsored the Washington meeting
for the regional Anti-Terrorism Advisory Council (ATAC).
ATAC is an FBI-sponsored group that involves local and
regional law enforcement in an information-sharing forum, and
Amtrak OIG agents participate in several ATAC meetings across
the country.
The OIG reiterates its concern that more federal funds should be
available for passenger rail security counter-measures. While
Amtrak finally became eligible to receive a portion of new secu-
rity-related appropriations for rail and transit operations,
Congress must do more to address the shortfall, particularly in
the area of adding canine units, improving retention of Amtrak
Police, and acting on recommendations included in Amtrak’s
security funding plans.

INTERNAL OPERATIONS REVIEWS
Control Deficiencies were noted in record-keeping, follow-
up, and segregation of duties.
Report #108-2005 – Issued 07/27/2006
The Amtrak Police Department (APD) participates in a federal
asset-sharing program known as the Federal Equitable Sharing
Program. This program is authorized under the Comprehensive
Crime Control Act of 1984 (Act). The Act authorizes the
Attorney General to share proceeds from seized assets with
participating state and local law enforcement agencies. The
objective of this audit was to determine if APD was complying
with the procedures outlined in the guide published by the
Department of Justice (DOJ) in March 1994 and a subsequent
addendum in March 1998.

    Baggage Handler, who was alleged to be punching in at the
    time clock and either leaving the station without permission or
    refusing to work. It was also alleged that the employee asked
    other employees to punch in their time card when they were
    going to be late. As a result of the investigation, the Baggage
    Handler was charged with violations under Amtrak’s
    Standards of Excellence and received a letter of counseling.

 OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
 REVIEW OF LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS
 4/1/06 – 9/30/06
 Section 4(a) of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, provides that the Inspector General shall …review existing and proposed
 legislation and regulations relating to programs and operations of such establishment and to make recommendations in the semiannual reports
 … concerning the impact of such legislation or regulations on the economy and efficiency in the administration of such programs and opera-
 tions administered or financed by such establishment or the prevention and detection of fraud and abuse in such programs and operations.
 The Office of Inspector General has an agreement with Amtrak’s Government and Public Affairs Department that allows the OIG to review
 and comment on the company’s annual legislative program and other legislative and regulatory concerns of the company. Existing legislation
 and regulations are reviewed as necessary, as a part of every audit and investigation.
 The OIG has also submitted legislative recommendations to oversight and appropriating committees seeking line item funding and several
 other legislative changes that will strengthen OIG independence and effectiveness.
