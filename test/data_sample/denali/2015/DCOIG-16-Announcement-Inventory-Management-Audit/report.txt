SUBJECT:                     Audit Announcement: Denali Commission Inventory Management

We are initiating an audit of the Denali Commission’s inventory management and equipment
acquisition process. Our objectives are to determine whether the Commission’s processes and
procedures for inventory management and equipment acquisition are sufficient to ensure that
federal assets and funds are being appropriately managed. We will begin the audit today by
performing a 100 percent inventory of all Commission-owned accountable property.

I will be in contact with you soon to schedule an entrance conference, at which time we will
discuss the audit’s scope and methodology in greater detail. If you have any questions regarding
this audit, please contact me at (206) 220-7970. We thank you in advance for your cooperation
during this review.
