Dear Chairmen Johnson and Grassley and Ranking Members Carper and Leahy,

In response to your request of February 27, 2015, we are providing current information on
our office’s open and unimplemented recommendations. As you may be aware, the
Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General (OIG) entered into an agreement
with the Denali Commission on May 28, 2014, to provide a full range of inspector general
(IG) services. Pursuant to that agreement, I have been named acting Inspector General for
the Denali Commission. Our answers to your request are numbered below in accordance
with the numbering on your request.
   1. After reviewing the limited records of the former IG last year, we identified 17
      open recommendations. We worked with the Commission leadership to resolve all
      but one of the unimplemented recommendations (see enclosure 1). The
      Commission leadership is working with their newly hired counsel to determine
      their position on the recommendation. There are no cost savings associated with the
      open recommendation.
   2. There are no audits, evaluations, or investigations provided to the Commission for
      comment but not responded to within 60 days.
   3. There are no investigations involving GS-15 level or above staff.
   4. There are no reported instances of whistleblower retaliation.
   5. There are no instances of Commissioners or Commission staff attempts to interfere
      with IG independence.
   6. Based on our review of the records we were able to retrieve from the former IG, we
      found no evidence of instances of Commissioners or Commission staff resisting or
      objecting in a significant manner to Denali OIG oversight. OIGs operate in
      environments where a certain tension inherently exists between them and the
      agencies they oversee; there were definitely tensions between the Commission and
      the former IG. However, since assuming the IG role for the Denali Commission,
      my office has not had any instances where the agency refused to provide, or
      otherwise delayed or restricted my office’s access to, records or other information.
   7. Lastly, there are no closed investigations, evaluations, or audits that were not
      disclosed to the public since we assumed the role of IG for the Denali Commission
      on May 28, 2014. We found no evidence of undisclosed reports in our review of the
      former IG’s records.
If you have any questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to
contact me at (206) 220-7970.
Sincerely,


David Sheppard
Acting Inspector General, Denali Commission

      Enclosure 1. Denali Commission OIG’s Open and Unimplemented
                   Recommendations as of March 6, 2015
        Report            Report          Unimplemented Recommendation
                           Date             (According to Prior Inspector General)

Inspection of Port       September   Denali should include a grant condition for
Graham Police and Fire     2009      publicly recording a Notice of Federal Interest in
Station                              the land records for a funded facility. This notice
                                     should define the parameters of permissible-use
                                     over time—and the solution for an unneeded,
                                     misused, or abandoned building.
