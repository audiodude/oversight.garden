## Oversight.io

Bringing into sight the work of the United States government's oversight community.

A small website (in progress!) at [oversight.io](https://oversight.io).

### Getting started

It's an [Express 4.x app](http://expressjs.com) in [Node](http://nodejs.org/) (JavaScript). It uses [Elasticsearch](http://elasticsearch.org/) as a search engine. Install all those things.
