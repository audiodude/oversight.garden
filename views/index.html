    <h1>About Oversight</h1>

    <p>
      The US government has many dozens of offices dedicated to keeping the government honest and efficient through strong, independent oversight.

      They produce a lot of good work, but the results are scattered all over the internet. Sometimes they get the attention they deserve, and many times they don't.

      It would be a shame for good oversight to go overlooked. We gather the work of the US government oversight community in one place so you can freely search and subscribe to it.
