    <p>
      Most every piece of the US federal government has an office called the <strong>Inspector General</strong> (IG).
    </p>
    <p>
      An IG's job is to keep their part of the government honest and efficient through strong, independent oversight.
    </p>
    <p>
      IGs produce a lot of work, but their reports are scattered all over the Internet. Some get the attention they deserve, and some don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>It would be a shame for good oversight to go overlooked.</strong> We gather them in one place so you can freely search and subscribe to them.

          Waste and Mismanagement at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board</a>
        (<a href="http://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/13-1077.pdf">PDF</a>)
      </h4>
      <p>
        The US Patent Office's board of appeals wasted $5 million since 2009 by paying people to do nothing, as the nation's patent backlog continued rising. Senior management knew of this and allowed it to continue.
