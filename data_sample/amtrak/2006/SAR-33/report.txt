Honorable David Laney
Chairman
Amtrak Board of Directors

Dear Mr. Chairman:

This report, submitted pursuant to the Inspector General Act, summarizes the more significant
audits, evaluations, and investigations for the six-month period ending March 31, 2006.

In the past six months, we have continued to work with the Board and management to identify
areas for improvement in Amtrak’s programs and operations. In particular, we have committed
to assisting the corporation in furthering its published strategic reform initiatives.

We issued 21 audit reports in the last two quarters, including performing information tech-
nology security reviews, compliance with environmental regulations, and compliance with sole
source procurement requirements. We also continued our review of Amtrak’s efforts to
strengthen internal controls around financial statement reporting, and we made additional
recommendations to the Finance department to strengthen further their control environment.

Our investigators and special agents opened 75 new cases in the past six months and closed
134 cases; 319 investigations remain active as of March 31. Amtrak and the Department of
Justice settled a long-standing contract fraud case for $24.75 million; this settlement was
achieved only through the hard work of several dedicated OIG staff and OIG counsel. We
have eight criminal and civil fraud cases pending with Federal prosecutors.

The OIG Inspections and Evaluations team has been working with senior managers to improve
Amtrak’s Acela operations and has been actively participating in the Acela Oversight
Committee. We conducted a review of the root causes for on-time performance delays, and we
have facilitated the introduction of reliability-centered maintenance for the Acela trainsets. In
addition, at your request, we have also worked with management to have them prepare a more
comprehensive fleet management plan.
Honorable David Laney

We are continuing our review of police and security operations, and we are evaluating the progress
made by the company in responding to the recommendations included in our June 2004 RAND-led
security report. We plan to augment the capabilities of the OIG security oversight group before the
end of the fiscal year, and we have also engaged Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories to assist
us in reviewing specific vulnerabilities at major Amtrak stations.

I appreciate your and the Board’s continued support of the OIG’s oversight efforts.

Respectfully,




Fred E. Weiderhold

MID-YEAR PERFORMANCE
Amtrak completed its first two quarters, through March 31,
2006, slightly ahead of budget projections for both revenues and
expenses. Ticket-related and state support revenues were $729.6
million, $12.2 million better than budget. Operating expenses
were $1.2 billion, $14.4 million better than budget. Adjusted
losses for the company were $611.3 million, with a total favor-
able budget variance of $60.4 million. When compared to FY
2005, Amtrak was $33.8 million favorable to the prior year.
Total ridership was 11.56 million, slightly better than projected,
with 26.2 cents revenue per passenger mile.
Amtrak’s system-wide on-time performance continued to suffer,
primarily as the result of poor support from the underlying
freight carriers, slipping from 72.2 percent in FY 2005 to 67.9
percent YTD for FY 2006. Some train performance reached all-

Amtrak has been very busy over the past several years making
substantial investments in its infrastructure, particularly for its
Northeast Corridor rail assets. Year-to-date for the six-month
period, Amtrak has spent over $258 million in general capital,
with $150 million spent by Amtrak Engineering ($65 million for
track/interlocking, $26 million for the New York Fire, Life,
Safety project, $12 million for signal work, $12 million for
bridges, and the balance for other projects), and $88 million
spent by the Mechanical Department for rolling stock ($29
million for the bi-level Superliner refurbishments, $26 million
for the Amfleet equipment, and $22 million for locomotive
repair and overhauls). While the OIG agrees that many of the
capital investments appear reasonable and necessary, we are
encouraging the company to use more asset-based metrics in its
performance analyses. We have not yet seen the company

OIG Joint Department Efforts
As set forth below, during this period, the OIG – Investigations,
Inspections and Evaluations and Audit – completed a joint inves-
tigation project and continues work on a previously reported
project. Highlights of these efforts are discussed below:

NORTHEAST CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
CONTRACT-RELATED FRAUD –
$24.75 MILLION SETTLEMENT
In conjunction with Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor Improvement
Project, a contractor was awarded a federally funded multi-year
contract to electrify Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor rail lines
between New Haven, Connecticut and Boston, Massachusetts.
The OIG, in conjunction with the United States Department of
Justice, conducted an investigation spanning several years,
millions of documents, and utilizing many different personnel
and expertise within the office. The investigation uncovered
evidence that Amtrak was defrauded by more than $50 million in
connection with the fixed-price contract of $305 million; the
total contract ultimately grew to exceed $485 million. The
OIG’s investigation began with a 1995 tip and was supplemented
in 1999 when a “whistleblower” who had formerly been
employed by the contractor on the project, filed suit under the

 REVIEW OF LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS
 10/1/05 – 3/31/06
 Section 4(a) of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, provides that the Inspector General shall …review existing and proposed
 legislation and regulations relating to programs and operations of such establishment and to make recommendations in the semiannual reports
 … concerning the impact of such legislation or regulations on the economy and efficiency in the administration of such programs and opera-
 tions administered or financed by such establishment or the prevention and detection of fraud and abuse in such programs and operations.
 The Office of Inspector General has an agreement with Amtrak’s Government and Public Affairs Department that allows the OIG to review
 and comment on the company’s annual legislative program and other legislative and regulatory concerns of the company. Existing legislation
 and regulations are reviewed as necessary, as a part of every audit and investigation.
 The OIG has also submitted legislative recommendations to oversight and appropriating committees seeking line item funding and several
 other legislative changes that will strengthen OIG independence and effectiveness.
