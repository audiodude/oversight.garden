The Honorable Jason Chaffetz                 The Honorable Elijah E. Cummings
Chairman, Committee on Oversight             Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight

Dear Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings,

We are providing our response to your August 27, 2015 request regarding inspectors general’s
access to information. As you noted in your letter, I agree that “independence and a right to
access all of the agency’s documents and information are foundational aspects of the IG
system…” I would like to thank you and the full committee for your leadership in ensuring those
principles are protected.

As you may be aware, the Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General (OIG) entered
into an agreement with the Denali Commission on May 28, 2014, to provide a full range of
inspector general services. Pursuant to that agreement, as amended, I was appointed by the
Denali Commissioners as the Inspector General (IG) for the Denali Commission on July 28,
2015. Since beginning my work with the Denali Commission in May 2014, my office has not
had any instances where the agency refused to provide, or otherwise delayed or restricted, access
to records or other information. While there was definite tension between the commission and
the former IG, as documented in the former IG’s last Semiannual Report to Congress, we were
not able to find any evidence of instances where commissioners or Commission staff resisted or
objected in any material manner to the former IG’s requests for documents or information.

Our answers to your specific questions are as follows:

   1. There were no instances within the last two years where the Denali Commission refused
      to provide timely, unfettered access to documents, information, or agency employees.
   2. There were no instances within the last two years where the Denali Commission delayed
      or improperly conditioned access to documents, information, or agency employees.
   3. There were no instances within the last two years where the Denali Commission provided
      access to documents, information, or agency employees, but asserted that, under the
      terms of the IG Act, the commission was not required to supply such access and may not
      comply with similar requests in the future.
If you have any questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me
at (206) 220-7970.

   Sincerely,



   David Sheppard
   Inspector General, Denali Commission
