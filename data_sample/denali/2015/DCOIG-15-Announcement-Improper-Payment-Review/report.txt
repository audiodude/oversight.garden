MEMORANDUM FOR:              Denali Commission Commissioners



FROM:                        David Sheppard
                             Acting Inspector General


SUBJECT:                     Review of the Commission’s FY 2014 Compliance with
                             Improper Payment Requirements

We are initiating a review of the Commission’s compliance with requirements of the
Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended and reported in the
“Other Accompanying Information” section of the Denali Commission FY 2014 Agency
Financial Report. The Office of Management and Budget issued implementing guidance in
the form of OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, as revised by OMB Memorandum M-15-
02, which requires federal inspectors general to review improper payment reporting
annually.

We will evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the Commission’s reporting and, if
applicable, its performance in reducing and recapturing improper payments. To comply
with legislative requirements, this review must be completed by May 15, 2015.

I will be in contact with you soon to schedule an entrance conference, at which time we
will discuss the review’s scope and methodology in greater detail. If you have any
questions regarding this review, please contact me at (206) 220-7970. We thank you in
advance for your cooperation during this review.
