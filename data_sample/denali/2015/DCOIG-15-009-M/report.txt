Ms. Sara Fisher-Goad, Executive Director
Alaska Energy Authority
813 W. Northern Lights Blvd
Anchorage, Alaska 99503

Dear Ms. Fisher-Goad,

We have scheduled a final audit of the Ruby Rural Power System Upgrade Award Number
1199, awarded to the Alaska Energy Authority (AEA). The audit will cover the award
performance period, 9/1/2009 through 9/30/2014, through the award close-out 3/5/2015.
The purpose of the final audit is to determine whether:

       costs incurred under the award were allowable, allocable, and reasonable;

       the power system is working and delivered as intended; and

       the method chosen for obtaining construction services was effective and efficient.

The auditors will call to arrange a mutually accepted time and location to hold our entrance
conference with you or your designated representatives, where we will discuss in greater
detail our objectives, scope, and methodology, as well as answer questions you may have
regarding the audit. Our goal is to hold this meeting and conduct fieldwork in the later part
of July 2015. We request the presence of key personnel and that the basic documents listed
in the enclosure be provided at the entrance conference. We may request access to any
contractor and consultant records and personnel; the auditor will determine whether access
is necessary after reviewing any contracts, consulting agreements, and other supporting
documentation available at AEA offices.

The auditors will require working space and access to a copy machine. We estimate site
work will take 1–2 weeks.
If you have questions regarding this audit, please call Gillian Brinkman at (907) 271-1779,
or either Chris Kapek or me at (206) 220-7970.

Regards,


David Sheppard
Acting Inspector General, Denali Commission
